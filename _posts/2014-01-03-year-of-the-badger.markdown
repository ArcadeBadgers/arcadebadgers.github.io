So, 2013 was an interesting year.

The Badgers officially started! Germies! was released! Then we went a bit quiet…

But, fear not, as we have been working on things. We have a few irons in the fire; Yargh! is being worked on, as well as a few smaller arcade-style games. We’re also working on the Wii U with something… aiming for Easter time, so there will be more of a mention on what we’re up to fairly soon. While I may have recently got a day job with YoYo Games ( see my personal blog on this: [http://www.stuckiegamez.co.uk](http://www.stuckiegamez.co.uk)), this does not really affect the Badgers a great deal as they’re entirely happy with me continuing with the Badgers as well.

So, what happened with Yargh! and the October Challenge? We were decanted, and it proved to be a bit trickier to get work done than we imagined! Now we’re back in our own space, we can get back to work on it and other things.

Here’s hoping that 2014 is the year of the Badger!
