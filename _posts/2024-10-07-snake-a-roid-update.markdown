Little bit shorter between updates, for a change!

We noticed that after the Google account hiccups a few years back, we lost our trailers for Grim and Snake-A-Roid. Neither of which we seemed to have back-ups of, unfortunately - due to another hiccup with said backup drive earlier this year, where it entirely crashed.

While Grim's trailer is lost entirely, we do have a new one for Snake-A-Roid, as work has progressed for the new update.

You can watch the new Snake-A-Roid trailer here, [on YouTube][youtube]!

And you can [wishlist the game on Steam!][steam]

This means that we are almost in a position to actually release something for a change! Germies is also coming on well and we do have mobile builds; but there are a few bugs still to iron out there.

So, yes! Snake-A-Roid is coming soon... in a new updated manner!
