one-liner: Low Rez Fish'n was a lowrezjam 2019 entry!
---

Low Rez Fish'n was our entry into the 2019 LowRezJam

# Description

Low Rez Fish'n is a small arcade-style fishing game, where you get a generated lake to fish for 16 unique items, before running out of time.

It was our first game written from scratch using a new toolchain, and in that regard it went very well. Even if it has no sound.
