So… the little Amazon EC2 instance was starting to get hammered for a bit. As such, I thought it might be a better idea to move (far) away from Wordpress and go static, as then I only really have to worry about using a CDN.

And that’s what we’ve done! Hopefully we’re a bit more stable and faster now. I haven’t quite moved everything over yet - the presskit stuff still needs some sorting out - but we’re mostly here.

We’re also officially two years old this month!

This year should hopefully bring us a new release, and some minor updates to Germies! as Clay are changing their API stuff.

Anyway, back to work!
