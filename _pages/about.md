<h1>We are the Arcade Badgers.</h1>

<p>Our goal is to make games as accessible and fun as we can.<br />
We like to do this by breaking down the more opaque genres - such as strategy games - and give our on little spin on them.<br />
And with a name like Arcade Badgers, we just have to put out the odd Arcade style game now and then too!</p>

<p>We are:</p>

<blockquote>Steven &#8220;Stuckie&#8221; Campbell</blockquote>

<p>Stuckie has worked on PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Wii, Wii U, Switch, 3DS, Xbox 360, Xbox One, Windows, Desktop and Embedded Linux, macOS, iOS, and Android for Playbox/Atomicom, YoYo Games, Arcade Badgers and himself.<br />
For Playbox/Atomicom, he has had a hand in developing the tech behind games such as Bang Bang Racing, Angry Wife, Switch, Hawthorne Park, and The Best Christmas Game Ever.<br />
For YoYo Games, he works on the Core Tech team, fixing bugs and adding <s>bugs</s> features to GameMaker Studio, both throughout 1.x and into 2.x<br />
He also takes part in various jams, creating experimental games, and operates a portfolio and blog over at <a href="http://www.stuckiegamez.co.uk">stuckieGAMEZ</a>.</p>

<blockquote>Claire &#8220;Octopi / Inky&#8221; Campbell</blockquote>

<p>Providing art, concept and design is the lovely Octopi. She keeps Stuckie in line and is immune to his crazy antics due to early exposure.<br />
She likes to fiddle about with Gamemaker and break anything Stuckie has done.<br />
She has been a gamer since she was 5 years old and is always trying to get her hands on the latest technology. She can usually be found gibbering away online somewhere.<br />
She keeps things in check to ensure we don&rsquo;t over reach ourselves in terms of scope, and has the last say on what gets focused on.</p>

<blockquote>Bowie, Zagreus and Thanatos Piggy Stardust</blockquote>

<p>We love guinea pigs at Arcade Badgers.<br />
They provide endless amusement as long as they are fed unlimited amounts of rocket, parsley, coriander and carrots.<br />
Living the high life, ours are effectively free-range piggies, and tend to get out to run around when they please - and show who&rsquo;s boss by scenting the living room when they don&rsquo;t get what they want.<br />
We have had many guinea pigs over the years; Loki, Thor, Cupid, Magni, Ragnarok and Piggy Stardust. Each one have had their own little personalities, and we look forward to being parsley slaves to many more!</p>

<blockquote>Noctis</blockquote>

<p>We now also have Noctis - a mix of Border Collie, Husky and Malamute. This makes him nosey, stubborn and full of mischief... who knows what we've let ourselves in for!</p>
