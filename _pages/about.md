<h1>We are the Arcade Badgers.</h1>

<p>Our goal is to make games as accessible and fun as we can.<br />
We like to do this by breaking down the more opaque genres - such as strategy games - and give our on little spin on them.<br />
And with a name like Arcade Badgers, we just have to put out the odd Arcade style game now and then too!</p>

<p>We are:</p>

<blockquote>Steven &#8220;Stuckie&#8221; Campbell</blockquote>

<p>Stuckie has worked on PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Wii, Wii U, Switch, 3DS, Xbox 360, Xbox One, Windows, Desktop and Embedded Linux, macOS, iOS, and Android for Playbox/Atomicom, YoYo Games, Arcade Badgers and himself.<br />
For Playbox/Atomicom, he has had a hand in developing the tech behind games such as Bang Bang Racing, Angry Wife, Switch, Hawthorne Park, and The Best Christmas Game Ever.<br />
For YoYo Games, he works on the Core Tech team, fixing bugs and adding <s>bugs</s> features to GameMaker Studio, both throughout 1.x and into 2.x<br />
He also takes part in various jams, creating experimental games, and operates a portfolio and blog over at <a href="http://www.stuckiegamez.co.uk">stuckieGAMEZ</a>.</p>

<blockquote>Claire &#8220;Octopi / Inky&#8221; Campbell</blockquote>

<p>Providing art, concept and design is the lovely Octopi. She keeps Stuckie in line and is immune to his crazy antics due to early exposure.<br />
She likes to fiddle about with Gamemaker and break anything Stuckie has done.<br />
She has been a gamer since she was 5 years old and is always trying to get her hands on the latest technology. She can usually be found gibbering away online somewhere.<br />
She keeps things in check to ensure we don&rsquo;t over reach ourselves in terms of scope, and has the last say on what gets focused on.</p>

<blockquote>Loki and Cupid</blockquote>

<p>Loki and Cupid are the Arcade Badgers guinea pigs.<br />
They provide endless amusement as long as they are fed unlimited amounts of rocket, parsley, coriander and carrots.<br />
Living the high life, they are effectively free-range piggies, and tend to get out to run around when they please - and show who&rsquo;s boss by scenting the living room when they don&rsquo;t get what they want.<br />
( Where is Magni, Thor and Ragnarok? Sadly, Thor passed away on 19th September 2014, Ragnarok passed on 23rd September 2014 and Magni passed on 15th February 2017. Stuckie wrote about them here: <a href="http://stuckiegamez.co.uk/thor/">Thor</a>, <a href="http://stuckiegamez.co.uk/ragnarok/">Ragnarok</a> and <a href="http://stuckiegamez.co.uk/magni/">Magni</a>)</p>
