Grim has been cleaning up the mess he has made for a few months now with your help, but Mama Grim thinks he deserves to be punished that bit longer.

Mama Grim has also persuaded us with her frying pan, that a price drop would be in our best interests, to give even more of you a chance to take Grim through the realms, and clean up the mess!

And that is precisely what we have done! You can now buy Grim for £1.99 / $3.49 / €2.49 ( depending on conversion rates and all that ) Go on, give him a hand… there’s 100 levels to clear up, after all!
