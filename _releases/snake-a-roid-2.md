one-liner: Snake-A-Roid is an Arcade Fusion of Asteroids and Snake!
---

Snake-A-Roid is an Arcade Fusion of various classics to produce a mix of unrelenting blasting action!

# Description

Snake-A-Roid is an Arcade style game that's been lost down the back of the sofa.
Featuring a clean vector-like style, and crunchy chip tune sound track, it evokes an era where games taunted you to spend your money, as you climbed to the top of that high score table.

Featuring three modes of play:
Arcade - run through the 10 arenas, each with multiple waves of asteroids and aliens, with an arena guardian to defeat.
Survival - pick an arena and chase that score, before your snake runs out of segments.
Boss Run - go toe to toe with all the arena guardians, one after the other, before facing off against The Badger.

Multiple power-ups to feed your snake, including:
3-way split shot
Faster bullets
Bigger bullets
Snake shield
Smart bombs
And the elusive extra life
All of which stack up to turn your garden snake into a death adder.
